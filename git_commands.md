## Git Commands
The most commonly used Git Commands I've been using, compiled here as a quick reference for instances where I may need to lookup a certain command.

### Create a Local Git Repo
Used to intialize a local git repository on your "local" computer.   
`git init`

### Add a File to be Tracked
Files can be tracked in Git using the <add> command.   
`git add <filename>`

To track all files in a folder, use the aesterisk symbol also called the "wildcard".   
`git add *`

### Commit a File to Git
Once a file is added to be tracked by Git, they're ready to be committed or saved.   
`git commit -m <message>`
